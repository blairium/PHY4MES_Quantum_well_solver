## PHY4MES_Quantum_well_solver

These matlab scripts make up the second computational lab for PHY4MES. These are largely the work of Alex Schenk with my own modifications. Any errors are my own.

### Part A:
The file Q1.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that plots the potentials for a 1D potential well

### Part B
The file QW_1.m is a matlab script that iteratively solves the coupled Poisson-Schrodinger equations to simulate a single finite potential well

### Part C 
The file QW_2.m performs in the same method as QW_1.m but for two finite potential wells

### Part D
GaAs_solver.m works as above to sinulate two quantum wells in GaAs/AlGaAs
